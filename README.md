# Rendezvous
Bluetooth Enabled Shuttle for Rendezvous in Space (Aerospace Exhibit)

This code base includes Arduino code for the Shuttle (Rendezvous.ino) and a C program (bluetest.cpp) for the Raspberry Pi Host.
The host code can be compiled under Windows for testing: the Raspberry Pi's GPIO inputs are faked with random bits and the outputs turn into stderr messages.
